# OrientationChatbot
This project features an AI-powered orientation chatbot designed to assist students with educational guidance, particularly in the Cycle Préparatoire Intégré and Engineering Cycle. Built on the TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 model, the chatbot has been fine-tuned to deliver accurate information and guidance.

Key features include: 
Text Generation: Provides accurate, AI-generated responses to user queries about educational programs.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts chatbot responses into audio, enhancing accessibility.
Speech Recognition: Allows users to interact with the chatbot using voice commands, making the experience more intuitive.

 While the chatbot currently has a 70% accuracy rate, it offers substantial orientation guidance, with ongoing improvements planned for increased reliability.
